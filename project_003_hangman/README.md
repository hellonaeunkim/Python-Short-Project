# project_003_hangman

* This code starts by importing necessary modules:<br><br>
  **random**: Used for selecting a random word from the list.<br>
  **stages**: This module is assumed to contain ASCII art representations of hangman stages.<br>
  **logo**: This module is assumed to contain ASCII art for the game's logo.<br>
  **word_list**: This module is assumed to contain a list of words that can be used for the hangman game.<br>
  **clear**: This is used to clear the console screen.<br><br>

  This code implements a simple hangman game where the player tries to guess a word, and the game keeps track of their progress, lives, and displays the hangman stage. The player wins by guessing all the letters or loses by running out of lives.
