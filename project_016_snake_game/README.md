# project_16_snake_game
The provided code is a Python implementation of a snake game. It consists of three classes:

1. Snake class: Manages the movement and segments of the snake. It creates the snake, adds segments, extends it, and moves it.

2. Food class: Represents the food for the snake. The food is displayed as a circle and is randomly positioned on the screen. When the snake collides with the food, it is refreshed at a new random location.

3. ScoreBoard class: Manages the score and game over state. It keeps track of the score, increases it when the snake eats the food, and displays game over messages.

In the main code section, the Screen class from the turtle module is used to set up the game screen and listen for user input to control the snake's direction. Within the game loop, collisions between the snake and the food are detected, as well as collisions with walls or the snake's own body, resulting in the game ending and the score and game over message being displayed.

In summary, this code implements a snake game where the user controls a snake that eats food to score points. The game ends if the snake collides with walls or its own body. The game screen is continuously updated, and the snake's direction is controlled by user input. The food's position is randomized, and the score and game over status are displayed on the screen.
