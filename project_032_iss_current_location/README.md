# project_032_iss_current_location

This Python code makes an HTTP GET request to a specific URL to retrieve real-time data about the International Space Station's current position. It then extracts the longitude and latitude coordinates from the JSON response and prints them as a tuple. This code is useful for tracking the ISS's location or integrating its data into other applications.
