# project_002_password_generator

This Python code is a password generator project that allows the user to create passwords of varying complexity. It provides an "easy" level where characters are chosen according to user input but not randomized in order and a "hard" level where the characters are selected and then shuffled to create a more secure, randomized password. The program prompts the user for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password and generates the password accordingly.
