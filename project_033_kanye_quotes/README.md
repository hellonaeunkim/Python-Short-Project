# project_033_kanye_quotes

This Python code creates a simple GUI application using tkinter. 
It displays a background image and a button with Kanye West's image. 
When the button is clicked, it fetches a random Kanye West quote from an API and displays it on the canvas. 
The GUI allows users to interactively receive new quotes by clicking the button.
