this Python code simulates the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It allows the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors and then randomly selects a choice for the computer. The code compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner and displays the ASCII art representing both choices. If the user inputs an invalid number, it prompts them to try again. The game logic includes win, lose, and tie conditions for Rock, Paper, and Scissors interactions.
